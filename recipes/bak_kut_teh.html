    <h1>Bak kut teh</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The chefs at Founder have been serving bak kut teh, 
    a peppery pork-rib soup from Singapore that's often eaten
    for breakfast, since 1978. Needless to say, they're the
    experts for this impossibly tender stew,
    which, as an added bonus, comes together all in one pot.</p>


    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
       <li>cups water</li>

       <li>2 tablespoons ground white pepper</li>

       <li>1 tablespoon ground black pepper</li>

       <li>2 teaspoons garlic powder</li>

       <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>

       <li>3 whole star anise</li>

       <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>

       <li>20 garlic cloves</li>

       <li>6 teaspoons dark soy sauce</li>

       <li>2 pounds pork ribs, rinsed and drained, cut into 4 pieces</li>

       <li>Cooked rice, for serving</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large pot, add all the ingredients,
            except the pork ribs, and bring to a boil over high heat. 
        </li>
        
        <li>Add the pork ribs to the broth and bring back to a boil,
            then lower the heat and let it simmer on low for 1 hour 
            and 15 minutes, or until the pork is tender.</li>
                
        <li>Turn off the heat and cover for 10 minutes.
            Serve hot with rice. </li>
    </ol>
